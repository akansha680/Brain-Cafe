                    Khan Academy doesn't get top billing due to its popularity. Sal Khan and his team have earned their place by creating self-paced, free, source of online education that has become an industry standard. Khan academy provides an easy path for students to jump in and begin learning about any subject that they choose.
                    Khan Academy certainly has youth appeal with its avatars and ability to earn badges, but it is also an extremely viable option for adults wanting to improve their technical skills, or learn about subjects such as entrepreneurship.

                    One of the most exciting developments in the tech world is the number of people who are learning to write code. Codecademy allows students to select their goal/learning objective and then recommends the proper course for that student.



Codecademy works because it makes coding accessible to any interested student, provides practical recommendations for students who want to learn how to code but don't understand how these new skill might apply to their current job
